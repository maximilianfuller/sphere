## Gameplay
You wake up...you are stranded in a poorly textured grass field...and it gets
worse....

Zombez are coming!

The number of zombez remaining is displayed in the application output (janky,
but it works).

You will need to kill all of the zombies, using your infinite supply of mines
in order to "win the game." But beware, explosions may knock you over the
the edge of the world and into the bottomless abyss below.

But what if you could use the force of the explosions to your advantage...
