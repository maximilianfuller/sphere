COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE

Retries used: NONE (2 extra retries left)

[ ] Completed a design check
[ ] Participated in playtesting

Common Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] Camera or graphics object supports view frustum culling of axis-aligned bounding boxes

Voxel Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] Collision detection and sliding response with collided blocks for arbitrary size axis-asligned bounding boxes
[ ] Per-chunk dynamic VBOs
[ ] Texture atlas support for per-chunk VBOs (must use the texture coordinates in the VBO)

Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] Movement and view controls must the same as warmup (including gravity and jumping)
[ ] The world must consists of a 10x2x10 grid of size C = 32 chunks
[ ] The game must run at 40+ FPS on department machines: this requirement overrides the standard 30+ FPS requirement
[ ] All terrain is textured from a single atlas

Global requirements
========================================
[ ] Top-level handin directory contains a Qt project file, a README, and an INSTRUCTIONS file
[ ] README has a copy of the rubric with explanations of how to verify requirements
[ ] README documents any known bugs
[ ] README indicates number of hours taken
[ ] INSTRUCTIONS contains all information needed to play the game
[ ] Engine and game code logically separated
[ ] Engine code well designed
[ ] Game code well designed
[ ] Runs on department machines
[ ] Does not crash
[ ] Works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
[ ] Runs at 30+ UPS and never dips below 20 UPS unless indicated in the specific handout

# Common Engine Reqs
* See camera and graphics object

# Voxel Engine Requirements
* Play the game and see the world for yourself.

# Game requirements
* Same as above.
