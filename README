COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE

Retries used: NONE (2 extra retries left)

[ ] Completed a design check
[ ] Participated in playtesting

Voxel Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] Analytic voxel-based raycasting
[ ] Automated chunk streaming 
	[ ] Chunks within a certain distance of a selected focus point are automatically loaded into the game
	[ ] Loaded chunks outside a certain distance are unloaded from the game

Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] Addition and removal of blocks
	[ ] Ray shot from the camera eye extending along the look vector
	[ ] Visual highlighting of the nearest intersected face
	[ ] Targeted block can be removed
	[ ] Block can be added to the empty block adjacent to the targeted face
	[ ] Addition or removal of blocks updates the appropriate VBO's
[ ] Continuous chunk streaming
	[ ] Chunks within 2 chunks of the player must be in memory
	[ ] Chunks further than this distance must be unloaded from memory (you do not need to save changes to unloaded chunks)
	[ ] Initialization of newly visible chunks must be spread across multiple frames or performed in a separate thread
[ ] Simplistic enemies
	[ ] Spawn either at the beginning of the game or at intervals during play
	[ ] Collide and interact with both the world and the player
	[ ] No complex AI required, but cannot remain stationary or jump in place
[ ] It must be possible to restart the game without quitting the program
[ ] The game must have at least two screens

Global requirements
========================================
[ ] Top-level handin directory contains a Qt project file, a README, and an INSTRUCTIONS file
[ ] README has a copy of the rubric with explanations of how to verify requirements
[ ] README documents any known bugs
[ ] README indicates number of hours taken
[ ] INSTRUCTIONS contains all information needed to play the game
[ ] Engine and game code logically separated
[ ] Engine code well designed
[ ] Game code well designed
[ ] Runs on department machines
[ ] Does not crash
[ ] Works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
[ ] Runs at 30+ UPS and never dips below 20 UPS unless indicated in the specific handout

# Raycasting
* Note that the faces of blocks are highlighted when the camera is oriented towards them.
* Note also, that there is a max raycast distance for block addition and removal, which may be customized, or removed altogether.

# Chunk streaming
* Move through the world, and note that chunks are generated on the fly in front of the player, and removed on the fly behind the player.
* Note that moving back and forth over a chunk boundary does not kill the framerate.

# Game requirements
* Play the game!
